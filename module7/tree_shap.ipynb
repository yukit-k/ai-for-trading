    "\n",
    "Let's say that we've trained a complex model on 3 features.  If it's given no inputs to make a prediction, then its prediction would be the equal weighted average of all its training samples.  \n",
    "Let's say that equal weighted average of the training labels is **100**.  In other words, if a model is given no features and asked to make a prediction, it would predict 100, which is the expected value based on the training labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's say we give the complex model a single sample observation, with all three features, and the complex model gives a prediction of **200**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The additive feature attribution model may assign feature importances to the three features like this:  \n",
    "feature 0: +50  \n",
    "feature 1: +90  \n",
    "feature 2: -40  \n",
    "\n",
    "So this is saying that feature 0 pushed the complex model's prediction up by 50, feature 1 pushed the complex model's prediction up by 90, and feature 2 pushed the model's prediction down by 40.  The end result was to go from the expected value of 100 to the prediction of 200.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shapley values that we just calculated are these values that push the model's prediction from the average of the training labels to the model's final prediction.  When we add up the shapley values for all the features, they add up to the model's prediction."
