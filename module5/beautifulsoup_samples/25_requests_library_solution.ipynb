    "In the cell below, print all the 28 tweets in our Twitter page https://twitter.com/AIForTrading1. Start by importing the `BeautifulSoup` and `requests` libraries. Then use the `requests.get()` function with the appropriate `params` to get our website's HTML data. Then create a BeautifulSoup Object named `page_content` using our website's HTML data and the `lxml` parser. Then use the `find_all()` method to find all the `<div>` tags that have `class=\"js-tweet-text-container\"`. Then, set a counter to count each tweet. Finally, create a loop that prints all the tweets. Print the counter next to each tweet as well."
